## Download

## Why

There are many ways to ensure a clean, efficient, and standardized workflow, such as:

- Enforcing documentation
- Scripts to format code

Why not use a user-friendly app to do these things?

We need a tool to improve our work efficiency, and we'd like it to have the following features:

- Manage multiple projects
- When creating a project, the behind-the-scenes work includes but is not limited to:
  - Scaffolding project folders
  - Initializing Git repositories and remote repositories
  - Preparing CI/CD scripts
- Assisting users in writing well-formatted `commit messages`
- Quickly generating app icons for multiple platforms

## Our Other Projects
